        "It's better to let someone think you are an Idiot than to open your mouth and prove it.",
        "Hell is wallpapered with all your deleted selfies.",
        "It looks like your face caught on fire and someone tried to put it out with a hammer.",

        "What language are you speaking? Cause it sounds like bullshit.",
        "You're the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard.",
        "You are proof that evolution CAN go in reverse.",
        "I don't think you are stupid. You just have bad luck when thinking.",
        "If I had a face like yours, I'd sue my parents.",
        "So, a thought crossed your mind? Must have been a long and lonely journey.",
        "I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.",
        "Calling you an idiot would be an insult to all stupid people.",
        "Aha, I see the Fuck-Up Fairy has visited us again!",
        "I would love to insult you... but that would be beyond the level of your intelligence.",
        "Keep talking, someday you'll say something intelligent!"
