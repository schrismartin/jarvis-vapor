Jarvis is a bot made with the intention of providing additonal functionality to the GroupMe group messaging platform. 

## ðŸ“– Documentation

You can check out the documentation for this project by visiting [here](http://schrismart.in/jarvis-vapor).

## ðŸ“± Usage

Currently, the bot will respond to the following commands: 

* `jarvis echo [message]`Â â€“Â Jarvis will respond to the group with "Echo: [message]".
* `jarvis info messages` â€“ Jarvis will tell how many messages the group has sent
* `jarvis info members` â€“Â Jarvis will tell about how many people are in the group.
* `jarvis info age` â€“Â Jarvis will respond with the created date of the group.

More commands are being added every day. Check back for an updated list. 

## ðŸ”§ Building

To build this project, you should be able to clone the project and use `swift build`. A more comprehensive build can be triggered by calling `vapor build`. The Project requires three environment variables to be set: 

- `GROUP_ID` â€“ This is the identifier for the group that the bot is present in.
- `BOT_ID` â€“ Used to make calls as the bot in question.
- `BOT_NAME` â€“ This determines the Bot's name â€“Â for our purposes, we like to use `Jarvis`, although this is fully configurable.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN` â€“ This is your user access token granted to you on GroupMe page. This is a requirement in order to query for information about your group.
